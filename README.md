Card game made in java where you can review cards, create deck with them and then battle with bot. Card art is custom made by me, but not for all cards. Game takes inspiration from Blizzard game Hearthstone, but it takes only some of it aspects. Aspects such as minions, spells and turn style.
Game has executable file in folder out. You need java version 17+ for lauching the game.
Game rules is implemented in game when rules button is clicked.
